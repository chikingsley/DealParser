# BotStream User Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of using the BotStream Telegram bot to manage affiliate deals.

## 1. Adding Deals

1.  **Open Telegram and find the BotStream bot.**
2.  **Send a message containing your affiliate deal information.** Use a clear format, including the following fields:
    *   `GEO`: (e.g., US, UK, CA)
    *   `Partner`: (e.g., AcmeCorp, BetaCo)
    *   `Price`: (e.g., $100, ¬£50)
    *   `CR`: (Conversion Rate, e.g., 10%, 15%)
    *   `Sources`: (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook)

    Example:  `GEO: US Partner: AcmeCorp Price: $100 CR: 10% Sources: Google Ads`

3.  **The bot will process your message and display the parsed deal information.**  If multiple deals are detected in your message, you will be able to navigate between them.
